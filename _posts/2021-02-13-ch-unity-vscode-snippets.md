The Unity VSCode Snippets extension for Visual Studio Code is a useful tool designed to enhance the productivity of Unity game developers by providing a library of common code snippets. Whether you're a seasoned Unity developer or just starting your journey into game development, this extension will save you valuable time and streamline your coding workflow.

### Key Features
- **GameObject and Component classes**: Create, reference and manipulate GameObejects with ease.
- **Mathf, Vector and Quaternion classes**: Yep math is covered, you can now write the code rather than dig into the documentation.
