It's a beautiful, snowy day in the neighborhood. School's cancelled, so it's time for a snowball fight! Play as a group of friends taking up the mantle of defending their homes from imaginary monsters with nothing but snowballs, cocoa, and their wild imaginations.

Immerse yourself in a rich and rewarding tactical experience! As you fight, your imagination will begin to run wild. With this power, you can bring imagination to life! Soar through the air, create the ultimate unbreakable anti-everything shield, and more! After each level, choose three new powers to add to your team! There's no wrong answers, so let your imagination run wild!
