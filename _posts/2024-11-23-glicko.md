A Unity C# implementation of the Glicko-2 player rating system sourced from [@TaylorP](https://github.com/TaylorP) in his C++ implementation [TaylorP/Glicko2](https://github.com/TaylorP/Glicko2). Glicko and Glicko-2 are alternatives to traditional Elo rating systems. Glicko was developed by Mark Glickman; the theoretical details of the system is described on [Dr. Glickman's website](http://www.glicko.net/glicko.html). Both the original Glicko and Glicko-2 rating systems are in the public domain.

While experimenting in with Unity Mirror, I became curious on possible ways to implement rating systems in multiplayer games. While reading I came a cross the Glicko system that is well respected. I realized there was no easy way to use it in the Unity engine and would have to rewrite it every time. So I decided to make a Unity package that would achieve this goal; an easily reusable implementation of the Glicko system in the Unity engine.
