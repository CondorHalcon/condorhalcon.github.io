This was my first project in Python. Finally, after understanding the concepts of programming in JavaScript I decided to test myself by learning a new language and writing a simple trading game in the new language. It was horendously messy and barely commented, but it worked! 

I have since then rewritten the program in other languages whenever I learn a new one to test my understating of the new language.
