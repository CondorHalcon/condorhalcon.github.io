    <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I embarked on my journey as a self-taught game programmer, and my passion for
        programming has led me to a new chapter in my education. In August 2023, I enrolled in the Academy of
        Interactive Entertainment (AIE) to further enhance my skills. Over the past nine years, I've immersed myself in
        the world of programming, delving into areas such as web development, server management, penetration testing,
        and, of course, game development.</p>

    <p>My initial fascination with programming sparked when I realized how a simple text document in Notepad could
        transform into a visually stunning web page with time and skill. Through unwavering dedication and countless
        hours of self-study, I've acquired proficiency in a range of programming languages, including C#, Python, and
        JavaScript. Now, as a student at AIE, I am on a mission to refine my game programming skills to meet industry
        standards and create unforgettable gaming experiences.</p>
